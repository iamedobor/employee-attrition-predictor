---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter employee data through the web form
2. **Prediction**: ML model analyzes 27 features
3. **SHAP Analysis**: Explains which factors drive the prediction
4. **Recommendations**: Provides targeted retention strategies

---

## 🔍 SHAP Explainability

The system uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to show:
- Which features increase attrition risk (red bars →)
- Which features promote retention (blue bars ←)
- The magnitude of each feature's impact
- Overall prediction confidence

---

## 💡 Sample Predictions

### High-Risk Employee
- Young, single, works overtime
- Low satisfaction scores
- Multiple previous employers
- **Result**: High likelihood to leave
- **Recommendation**: Address workload, compensation review

### Low-Risk Employee  
- Married, experienced, no overtime
- High satisfaction, good income
- Long tenure, recent promotion
- **Result**: High likelihood to stay
- **Success Factors**: Maintain current benefits

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Flask 3.0.0
- scikit-learn 1.5.1
- SHAP 0.44.1
